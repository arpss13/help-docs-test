After an app or desktop launches, you can navigate it using touch or with the Citrix X1 Mouse.

The toolbar allows access to many additional functions within Citrix Workspace app for iOS. To display the toolbar on an iPad, tap the arrow at the top of the screen inside an app or desktop. On an iPhone, tap the screen and a small grid appears near the bottom of the screen. Tap the grid to display the toolbar.

Tap **Home** within a running app or desktop to return to your home screen. Your app or desktop will still be running in the background. To get back to your running app or desktop on an iPad, tap the app icon and then tap **Open**. On an iPhone, tap the icon and the app or desktop launches again. You can also start a second app or desktop in the same session. On the toolbar, tap **Home** and then select the second app or desktop.

On an iPad, you can add a Bluetooth device by tapping **Pair**.
>*Note: The Bluetooth device you want to add to your session must already be paired to the iPad.*

Tapping **Arrow Keys** displays a virtual arrow key overlay that lets you navigate an app or desktop. Tapping the **Back** arrow on the overlay hides the arrow keys.

A floating keyboard is accessible by tapping **Keyboard**. You can also bring up the keyboard by using three fingers to tap the screen.

Instead of using touch, you can also use a mouse-style pointer. Tap **Pointer** to access it.

To magnify a small area inside an app or desktop on an iPad, tap **Magnifier** to zoom in as you drag across the area. To disable it, tap **Magnifier** again.

In an app that supports a mouse, tap **Mouse** on the toolbar to use a virtual floating mouse. The pointer above the mouse has focus. If you don't use it for a while, the mouse shrinks. To use it again, tap the floating mouse. To close the mouse and use touch within your session, tap **Mouse** again. To zoom in and out of an app or desktop using the mouse, use the mouse pointer and tap the magnifying glass icon on the mouse twice. To undo, tap twice again.
>*Note: You might have to manually bring up the keyboard when the mouse is enabled.*

To move between multiple open apps on an iPad, tap **Switch** to see all running apps and move between them. Swipe left to see one of your running apps. Swipe left and then right to see all your running apps. When the list of running apps appears, swipe up on the window of the running app to close the app.
>*Note: A pop-up window with these instructions appears when you first launch an app or desktop on an iPad. You can choose to have this window appear every time you launch an app or desktop, or hide it from subsequent launches.*

## Gestures

While using apps or desktops, you can use all the familiar iOS gestures to navigate, such as pinch-to-zoom. You can also use the in-session toolbar options. Use tap-and-hold on a scrollbar within a document to scroll up and down within that document. Tap, hold, and release to use right-click functions within apps and desktops.
