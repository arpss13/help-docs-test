            <h1 class="page-title">Settings Menu</h1>
            <p>To access the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, tap the gear icon in the top right corner on an iPad. On an iPhone, tap <strong>Settings</strong> on the bottom menu.</p>

<h2 id="display-options">Display Options</h2>

<p>There are several options to configure your resolution for apps and desktops. Tap <strong>Display Options</strong> and choose between Auto-fit Low, Auto-fit Medium, and Auto-fit High. On an iPhone, the options are Small, Medium, and Large. On an iPhone, you can also choose Auto-fit Screen. On an iPad, you can also enter a custom resolution for your session. The maximum custom resolution is the maximum resolution your iPad supports.</p>

<p>You also can display your Citrix Receiver session on an external display. This requires specific hardware or devices tht support Apple Play. After setting it up, tap <strong>External Display</strong> to push your session to the external display.</p>

<p>While using your iOS device with an external display, you can use your iOS device as a trackpad to control your session. To do this, tap <strong>Presentation Mode</strong> while in <strong>External Display</strong> mode.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: This option is available only while using <strong>External Display</strong> mode.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="keyboard-options">Keyboard Options</h2>

<p>Tap <strong>Use Unicode Keyboard</strong> to make use of a standard Unicode keyboard. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>On an iPad, tap <strong>Automatic Keyboard</strong> to ensure that any time within a session a keyboard is needed, the keyboard appears onscreen. This option is on by default.</p>

<p><strong>Extended Keys</strong> lets you use more keys within your session than the default iOS keyboard has. You can choose which keys you want for your keyboard for additional functions. On an iPad, choose <strong>Extended Keys</strong> to view the available keys. On an iPhone, the list of extended keys appears after you choose Keyboard Options. Tap the buttons to choose any extended keys you want to use.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Use Custom Keyboards</strong> to use third-party keyboards downloaded from the App Store within your session.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>Tap <strong>Audio</strong> to turn audio from your apps and desktops on or off. This option is on by default.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: This setting lets you listen only. Citrix Receiver for iOS does not offer bi-directional audio.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="advanced-settings">Advanced Settings</h2>

<p>Tap <strong>Use iPad Storage</strong> or <strong>Use iPhone Storage</strong> to use the internal storage of your device rather than saving documents to a cloud service or to your organization’s network server.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Ask Before Exiting</strong> to ensure that Citrix Receiver confirms with you before disconnecting any session.</p>

<p>On an iPad, tap <strong>Session Sharing</strong> to move your session from one device to another using Citrix Receiver and to continue to work in your open apps or desktops. This option is on by default if your organization supports it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: If session sharing is disabled or not an option (such as on the iPhone), when you tap <strong>Home</strong>, you disconnect from the session by default. Your apps continue to run on the server. You can roam to another device, log on to the same Citrix Receiver account, and resume using your apps and desktops.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tap <strong>Use Native Combo Box</strong> to use the iOS-native selection feature. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>On an iPad, tap <strong>Touch Enable</strong> to allow touch for all apps and desktops, including ones that do not have touch options enabled natively, such as Windows 7.</p>

<p>On an iPad, tap <strong>Fullscreen Window</strong> to view your apps and desktops fullscreen on your iPad device. This option is on by default.</p>

<p><strong>Workspace Control</strong> lets you automatically reconnect to a session launched from another device when you add an account or refresh the apps or desktops on the second device, if there is only one session available. Tap <strong>Reconnect during account login</strong> and/or <strong>Reconnect during refresh</strong> to enable these options.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Enable HTTP Proxy</strong> to use an HTTP proxy for your session. This option has to be configured in your device settings.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Enable Smart card</strong> to use a smart card within a session. This option is only to let you use a smart card within a session, not to authenticate to the session.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Session Reliability</strong> to ensure that your session stays connected, even if your network connection becomes poor or is interrupted.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Reset Receiver</strong> when you want to reset all settings and options, including removing all stores, certificates, logs, and accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: This operation is irreversible and cannot be undone.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wireless Trackpad</strong> lets you use a secondary iOS device as a remote trackpad to control Citrix Receiver apps or desktops on your primary iOS device. Both devices must have Citrix Receiver installed. Pairing controls only Citrix Receiver applications on your primary iOS device.</p>

<p>To enable <strong>Wireless Trackpad</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that Bluetooth or WiFi is enabled on both iOS devices.</li>
  <li>On the primary iOS device, launch Citrix Receiver and then launch the application you want to use.</li>
  <li>From the toolbar, tap <strong>Pair</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the secondary iOS device, launch Citrix Receiver, then tap <strong>Settings</strong></li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Wireless Trackpad</strong> and confirm the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>This pairing remains in place until you close the application on the primary iOS device.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Adaptive Transport Settings</strong> to switch EDT on or off. EDT delivers a superior user experience on long-haul WAN and internet connections. Tap <strong>Allow EDT</strong> to use adaptive transport. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>The Caffeine function allows your iOS device to stay awake, even while not in active use. Tap <strong>Caffeine</strong>, then tap <strong>Stay Awake</strong> to keep your device awake. By default, this option is turned off to conserve battery life.</p>

<h2 id="citrix-x1-mouse">Citrix X1 Mouse</h2>

<p>You can select options for the Citrix X1 Mouse hardware. Contact your Citrix representative for more information about the Citrix X1 Mouse.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Citrix X1 Mouse</strong> to switch access to your Citrix X1 Mouse on or off.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: The Citrix X1 Mouse and your iOS device must already be paired. For instructions on how to pair the two, see the documentation included with your Citrix X1 Mouse.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tap <strong>Left handed mouse</strong> to configure your Citrix X1 Mouse for a left-handed user, switching the mouse click buttons.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Use Remote Cursor Image</strong> to make your cursor match the app or desktop within a session. For example, if the cursor is over a text box, it changes to match the text box. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>You can also control the speed of the mouse cursor throughout your session. Move the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to your desired speed. You can choose any speed between 1.00 (the default speed) and 3.00.</p>
