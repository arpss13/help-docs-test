Citrix Workspace app for Windows allows the operating system to control the session resolution.

You can apply high DPI in a session, but the feature is disabled by default. When disabled, the session scaling follows the operating system resolution.

## To configure DPI scaling using the graphical user interface (GUI)

> **Note:**
>
> You can hide all or part of the Advanced Preferences sheet available from the Citrix Workspace app icon in the notification area. For more information, see [Hiding the Advanced Preferences sheet](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace-app-for-windows/configure/config-xdesktop/hiding-the-advanced-preferences-sheet.html)

1.  Right-click Citrix Workspace app from the notification area.
2.  Select **Advanced Preferences** and click **High DPI**. The DPI settings dialog appears.
3.  Change the settings as required. By default, the option **Let the operating system scale the resolution** is selected.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Restart the Citrix Workspace app for Windows session for the changes to take effect.

**Limitations**

*  Even when this feature is enabled, a slight blur might occur in the desktop viewer.
*  In a session, when you change the DPI settings and relaunch it, the size of the session window might not be appropriate. As a workaround, resize the session window.
